# üöÄ Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

This repository contains my implementation of common data structures and algorithms using Python. These solutions are designed to be clear, efficient, and educational for those learning DSA concepts.

## üìã Contents

The repository includes solutions to various algorithm problems, including:

### String Manipulation
- **CamelCase Conversion**: Transform strings into camel case format
- **Vowel Counter**: Count non-vowel characters in a string
- **Palindrome Checker**: Determine if a string is a palindrome
- **Palindrome Substring Counter**: Count all palindromic substrings within a string
- **Palindrome Permutation**: Check if a string can be rearranged to form a palindrome
- **Substring Generator**: Print all possible substrings of a given string
- **Character Removal**: Remove all occurrences of a specific character from a string
- **Valid Anagram**: Determine if two strings are anagrams of each other

### Array/List Algorithms
- **Duplicate Removal**: Remove duplicate elements from an array
- **Two Sum**: Find indices of two numbers that add up to a target
- **Sliding Window**: Find maximum sum of a subarray of size k
- **Rescue Boats**: Greedy algorithm to determine minimum number of boats needed
- **Spiral Matrix Traversal**: Print matrix elements in spiral order

## üíª How to Use

Each file is a standalone Jupyter notebook that can be run in environments like Google Colab, Jupyter, or any Python environment that supports `.ipynb` files.

Example usage:
```python
# For the Two Sum algorithm
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
result = two_sum(nums, target)
print(result)  # Output: [0, 1]
```

## üß© Problem Solving Techniques Demonstrated

- **Hash Maps/Dictionaries**: Used in anagram detection and palindrome permutation checks
- **Two Pointer Technique**: Implemented in palindrome checking and rescue boats problem
- **Sliding Window**: Optimizing subarray problems
- **Matrix Traversal**: Spiral order traversal of 2D arrays
- **String Manipulation**: Various techniques for processing and analyzing strings

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills Practiced

- Algorithm optimization
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Python data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets)
- Problem decomposition
- Clean code practices

## üöÄ Future Additions

I plan to add more algorithms covering:
- Graph algorithms
- Dynamic programming
- Binary trees and binary search trees
- Sorting and searching techniques
- Advanced data structures
